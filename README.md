# TorusLife
A simple web app demonstrating Conway's Game of Life on a 3D toroid grid.

# Simulation controls for the eXpanded version

P: Pause the simulation

S: Step the simulation by one round

C: Clear simulation

R: Randomly fill cells

A: Altitude enabled. When this option is turned on, the altitude of each cell will rise each round to visualize its age.

# Special pattern inputs

These are some of the special patterns that commonly arise in Conway's Game of Life. This blogpost by Paul Lefebvre goes into great detail, I highly recommend you check it out: [https://blog.xojo.com/2022/05/11/conways-game-of-life/](https://blog.xojo.com/2022/05/11/conways-game-of-life/)
